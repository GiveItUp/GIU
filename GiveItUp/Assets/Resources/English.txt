At last!#
You seem to be a gamer...#
I see you keep practicing.#
Not so hard,_is it.#
Just a little practice and you can finish it.#
Whoo, it's almost done!#
You must be angry._Try again!#
Just a little more and it's done!#
You don't give up,_do you.#
Not just try,_do it!#
That's it!# 
Good job!# 
At last!_Someone got this far!# 
One hundred percent!!_Believe it?# 
That's the way it's done!#
Tap at touchdown to make Blob jump. The rhythm of the music may help.#
Tap to jump up. Blob knows what to do.#
It's slightly harder: tap three times in a row to the rhythm of the jump.#
Blob is jumping down by itself.#
You don't always have to jump: take care of spikes hanging down.#
Tap now!#
GOOD LUCK#
TAP#
